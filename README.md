# Psychological & Behavioural distress of COVID-19

## `Preface`

The coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented health crisis. One of the biggest impacts of this situation has been the facts on our collective, mental health studies on the global burden of disease were already shown by WHO that mental disorders, make a 5 out of 10 leading causes of disability worldwide and this is before the pandemic started. The stress, anxiety, depression stemming from fear, isolation, and stigma around COVID-19 affected, all of us in one way or another. Many people are losing their jobs and the elderly are isolated from their usual support network. Of course, the past year has been hard on healthcare workers having to work long hours, personal risk of exposure to the virus, and witnessing firsthand the loss of people's colleagues and loved ones. The issue is that the effects of the pandemic and mental health, maybe for longer-lasting than the disease itself.    

Indirectly, the measures are taken to slow, the spread of the virus has affected our physical activity levels, our eating behaviors, our sleep patterns, and our relationship with addictive substances, including social media. Into this last point, both our increased use of social media while stuck at home, as well as the increased exposure to disaster news past year, have amplified the negative effects of social media on our mental health. This motivates us to perform some diagnostic analysis of this pattern and portray some meaningful insights on global survey data.
