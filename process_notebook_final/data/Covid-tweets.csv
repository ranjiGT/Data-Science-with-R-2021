"7243","@BCollier2012 Less adherence to social distancing. And less enforcement. #Covid19 And a complete avoidance of the discussion of vaccinating Children and Young People for nigh on two years might have something to do with it, as predominant asymptomatic transmission."
"7244","Think about it. We had ""science"" during #Covid19 that told vulnerable and marginalised people at home.....to look into the eyes of the dead or dying. Or struggling staff members, in order to stay home and not seek help in appropriate health behaviours. Thats absolutely shocking."
"7245","I find it absolutely bizarre how we accept during the #Covid19 Pandemic a Public Information film in the UK....and from science, being told to #ProtectTheNHS which had absolutely no legal or evidenced fact bar emotionality. And also ""looking into the eyes"" by guilty by ad."
"7246","I did mention it at the start of the #Covid19 Pandemic that the ""resilience of the NHS to cope"" was a strange measure that is always a problem. So can consistently be used to regulate society if it was mismanaged. And no one would question. And I was right. Funny that."
"7247","Anyone else find it odd....that one of the measures of #Covid19 social progression so to speak and management was the capacity of the NHS to cope. Which was based on so many other factors. So isnt a measure at all. As its underresourced. So its a constant inhibition available."
"7248","@AstraZeneca It’s time to suspend your vaccine patents, and share technology &amp; know-how to ensure that everyone, everywhere is safe from #COVID19. We need a #PeoplesVaccine, not a profit vaccine. #JoinCTAP #TRIPSwaiver https://t.co/ptHmfgHi7y"

"8636","Of those 1,319 individuals, 505 had symptoms, 377 had no symptoms, and an additional 437 did not have this information available in their charts. 92 of these individuals were hospitalized - 30 for reasons due to #COVID19."

"8644","It is reported that while breakthrough cases were seen in all vaccine-eligible age groups, hospitalizations &amp; deaths were only seen in those over the age of 50, and those over the age of 80 accounted for almost half of all hospitalizations &amp; half of deaths related to #COVID19."
